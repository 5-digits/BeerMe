Progressive Web App built with React. 

## Project Focus:
The focus of this project is to work with the latest web technologies out there and set up a playground to allow me to continue adapting new tech to an evolving application. 

## The Tech Stack:
  - PWA
  - ReactJS
  - LocalStorage API
  - Service Workers API
  - Google Maps API
  - Code Splitting with React Loadable
  - Webpack
  - Babel
  
## The UI:
Interface connects to [BreweryDB](http://www.brewerydb.com/about) API to allow users to search random beers by the beer style from their catalog, so they can hopefully find their new favorite beer.
